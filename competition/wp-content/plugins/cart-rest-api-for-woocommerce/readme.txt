#### Why WooCommerce?

CoCart chose to support WooCommerce because it provides a **flexible and efficient** way to build cutting-edge stores with WordPress at its core. However, it was missing a key component to decouple WooCommerce via the REST API efficiently. That’s where CoCart comes in.

#### Finally, a REST API that’s Easy and Powerful

Struggling with performance? Finding it hard to decouple WooCommerce from WordPress without hitting roadblocks? CoCart is here to eliminate the hassle of creating your own REST API endpoints for WooCommerce and provides all the essential features for a powerful, headless eCommerce experience making it easy to decouple WooCommerce from WordPress.

* **Source of Truth** - CoCart utilizes WooCommerce’s Data Stores API and mirrors most WooCommerce hooks, ensuring broad compatibility with numerous extensions right from the start.
* **No Cookie Required** - Our session handler generates a unique key for each user session in the WordPress database, storing session-related metadata on the client side without imposing a heavy load.
* **Easy Authentication** - No Admin API Keys required. Customers can log in with their account either with Email+Password, Username+Password, or Phone Number+Password.
* **Domain Dominance** - Addressing CORS issues in decoupled setups, CoCart grants you control over the origin.
* **Efficient Product Search** - Search products by name, ID, or SKU; filter and retrieve necessary product data without authentication, ensuring no private data is exposed.
* **Real-Time Cart Validation** - Our system minimizes the need for multiple requests to verify item and coupon validity in your cart. It efficiently checks stock, calculates totals and fees, ensuring real-time accuracy so your responses are consistently up-to-date.
* **No Headless Checkout?** - Easily load any cart session into the native WooCommerce checkout if you prefer.
* **Customizable Callbacks** - Register your own cart callbacks without creating new endpoints. CoCart handles the rest, returning responses once complete.
* **Customer Tracking** - Monitor all cart sessions, including those nearing expiration or already expired.
* **Name Your Price Built In** - Empower your customers to set their price, encouraging support with flexible payment options that broaden your paying audience.
* **Bulk Requests** - Batch multiple cart requests at once for efficiency and faster responses.

And this is just the start. With CoCart, your WooCommerce store can be faster, more flexible, and ready to take on any custom solution you dream up.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does CoCart do? =

CoCart provides a REST API that is ready to decouple WooCommerce away from WordPress.

= Who should use CoCart? =

Pretty much everyone, who wants a faster eCommerce store to improve their business. WooCommerce runs multiple requests for multiple steps. We avoid the hassle of needing multiple requests for these steps and process them all together.

CoCart is perfect for eCommerce owners and developers who want to create an eCommerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API.

= Are there any limitations? =

CoCart is designed with developers in mind allowing for complete control to customize or add support for a plugin to work with CoCart. CoCart does its best to work out of the box but if there is a compatibility issue with a plugin that you would like to work with CoCart. We would be happy to hear about it.

= What is the source of truth? =

CoCart sources the WooCommerce’s Data Stores API and repeats most WooCommerce hooks to provide a wider array of support for most WooCommerce extensions out of the box.

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it on the sites you want to use CoCart.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless eCommerce on another domain? =

Absolutely. That is what CoCart is mainly developed for. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can manually enable it via the filters available [in the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

= Will CoCart interfere with other plugins? =

The majority of plugins are not REST API specific so it shouldn't. However, while we allow the source of truth for compatibility, there may be a WooCommerce extension that returns data via an action hook that the REST API cannot understand during a specific action and may fail the response.

If that does happen, simply report the situation with as much detail as possible on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues) and we will try our best to find a solution.

= How do I set up CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce installed and set up to your configurations. Then install CoCart, activate and you're ready to start using the REST API following the API Reference provided.

> Please check the requirements listed in the [installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) section.

= Why use CoCart and not WooCommerce’s Store API? =

WooCommerce’s Store API is designed for the Gutenberg blocks which only requires a fixed format and is still prone to be used on native storefronts. It also lacks validation on the server end which you will need and not every extension yet works with it out of the box. A lot of valuable information and abilities that developers require to help them are also unavailable and if you try to use the Store API for headless you will have issues managing the cart sessions.

CoCart's API is designed for decoupling away from WordPress with ease. It's a plug-and-play solution that just works out of the box. Also, improvements are always made to CoCart to ensure you get the best decoupled experience.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin provides a REST API built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation [here](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink).

= Can I change the formatting of values, add and change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. There are over 200+ filters available to customize to your needs.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler and table in the database? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the `shutdown` hook.
- The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
- The default session handler **does not support guest customers**.
- The default session handler **does not store additional data that may be required to help you**.
- The default session handler **does not allow support for POS capability**.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

No. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignores any custom REST APIs from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar except for WooCommerce Blocks and JetPack. We don't recommend it. However, [TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "[TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/)" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Can I use any modern stack? =

Yes, you can use your preferred tools and favorite modern technologies like [Astro](https://astro.build/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) and more giving you endless flexibility and customization.

= Can I install/update CoCart via Composer? =

Yes. The best method would be to install/update CoCart from the GitHub repository but you can also do so via [https://wpackagist.org/](https://wpackagist.org/search?q=cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce&type=plugin)

= Where can I report bugs? =

= v4.3.8 - 7th November 2024 =

### 🐛 Bug Fix

> Developer note: A commit was missing causing a fatal error when adding items to the cart.

### Changes

* REST API: Cart item prices correctly display based on tax options for the cart not the store.

= v4.3.7 - 5th November, 2024 =

### Bug Fixes

* REST API: Fixed rounding issue due to decimal separator being different with the cart total for some odd reason with WooCommerce.

* REST API: Only update cart item quantity if quantity is different when requested.
* REST API: Check cached price against price with tax mode not just the product price set.
* WordPress Dashboard: Adjusted notices to get cached for the current site should it be a multisite.
* WordPress Dashboard: No longer reset upgrade notice each time CoCart updates.

= v4.3.6 - 23rd August, 2024 =

### Bug Fixes

* REST API: View or deleting a session with the Sessions API was not accessing the session handler. No longer needs a separate load.

### Bug Fix

= v4.3.4 - 3rd August, 2024 =

### Bug Fix

= v4.3.3 - 24th July, 2024 =

### Corrections

* Autoload for classes in the backend corrected to new locations.
* Clean up task that is scheduled was looking for the session handler in the wrong place.
* Fixed `update_session_timestamp()` function from failing in session handler.

### Improvements

* REST API: Value of weight was returning in the wrong format. By returning as a string you get the true value without needing to round it up yourself.
* WordPress Dashboard: Updated add-on update watcher.

= v4.3.2 - 19th July, 2024 =

### 🌋 Hot Fix

This release fixes 3 known issues that were reported. [issue #425](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/425), [issue #426](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/426), [issue #427](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/427) that has been affected since version 4.2 of CoCart.

It was due to the optimizations made to allow CoCart to perform better. Unfortunately it had some unexpected side affects that were not picked up during testing. For that I am sorry. If you haven't rolled back to before 4.2 then this patch is highly recommended.

Previous patch releases will also be updated to prevent further sites from experiencing these issues for those who like to update to specific version of the plugin.

A hard lesson was learned here and hope you haven't lost trust in the plugin. I appreciate your feedback and support during this process.

Please don't forget to backup your site before updating.

### Corrections

* Plugin: Typo caused the WP-CLI commands to not register and crash when used with composer.
* REST API: The data exception class was oddly not loading when updating an item. Autoloader was not picking it up. Now it is required.
* REST API: Cart would empty but the subtotal would not reset.

### Improvements

* REST API: Ensure we have calculated totals before we get an item or update an item so we can identify them.

= v4.3.0 - 17th July, 2024 =

### What's New?

In this release we have added a plugin update prevention system as a safety measure. For the moment it will detect for compatibility with minor releases while we are making adjustments but it's designed mostly for detecting major changes. All CoCart add-ons that we release will now check for CoCart's requirements and will help you decide to update or not until your ready to do so.

* Plugin: Added plugin headers to be used for detecting CoCart add-ons or plugins that support CoCart.
* WordPress Dashboard: Auto-updates are disabled should a CoCart add-on active have not tested with the latest release available.
* WordPress Dashboard: Update now link for CoCart opens up a modal listing none tested plugins with a confirmation.

### Improvements

* REST API: Ensure we have calculated totals before we restore the requested item so we can identify them.

### For Developers

> These filters are for site admins more than anything.

* Introduced filter `cocart_in_plugin_update_message` allows you to change the upgrade notice.
* Introduced filter `cocart_get_plugins_with_header` allows you to get the plugins that have a valid value for a specific header.
* Introduced filter `cocart_get_plugins_for_cocart` allows you to get plugins which "maybe" are for CoCart.

### Compatibility

* Tested with WordPress v6.6
* Tested with WooCommerce v9.1

= v4.2.2 - 12th July, 2024 =

### Reverting

We are reverting a change for destroying a session. Previous change causes a conflict with identifying the correct column with our session table and causes the cart not to clear.

= v4.2.1 - 11th July, 2024 =

### Hot Fix

When loading a cart from session a deprecated function was still triggered. It's now been removed to prevent failing.

= v4.2.0 - 11th July, 2024 =

In this release we have optimized our session handler making this release more compatibility with third party plugins. We also no longer use cookies as a backup for headless. This should also help with the confusion of needing to pass along the session cookie or reading the cookie to extract the cart key and help with user switching much better. A cart key is provided in both the cart response and returned headers. Saving the cart key in your own cookie or local storage is fairly straight forward.

> We advise that you update on staging or local to check if you have used any of our experimental functions and filters that were added to the session handler to see if any have been deprecated. You can also see the list of deprecations below. If you have any questions about this update please contact us.

### What's New?

* REST API: Can now request a guest cart via a requested header `cocart-api-cart-key`.

### Improvements

* Session Handler: Improved identifying cart without the need of cookies.
* Session Handler: Added new function `is_user_customer()` to check the user role is a customer when authenticated before migrating cart from guest.
* Authentication: Validation for invalid details was taking too long and failed to return an error message.
* REST API: Updating the customer details in cart will now take additional billing and shipping fields as meta data. Validation is required by the developer using filter `cocart_update_customer_fields`.
* REST API: Sanitized and formatted customer email address and phone number.
* REST API: Formatted customer postcode if validated.
* REST API: Product image sizes are now fetched using utility products class function `get_product_image_sizes()`. Cuts down on the filter `cocart_products_image_sizes` being in multiple places.
* REST API: Currency in cart API v2 now returns `currency_symbol_pos` and the currency symbol will now return based on the set currency without lookup.
* REST API: Improved headers returned and added nocache headers on authenticated requests.
* REST API: Simplified returning the cart key to the headers.
* REST API: Loading of the REST API optimized.
* Plugin: Moved `is_rest_api_request()` function to the main class so it can be utilized outside of the plugin.
* Plugin: Localization improvements.
* Plugin: Updated plugin review notice.
* Plugin: Code files organized better.

### Deprecations

* Removed the need to support web host "Pantheon" by filtering the cookie name.
* Removed our session abstract `CoCart_Session` that extended `WC_Session`. Any remaining functions have moved to our refreshed session handler.

* Function `CoCart_Session_Handler::cocart_setcookie()` no longer used.
* Function `CoCart_Session_Handler::get_cart()` no longer used.
* Filter `cocart_cookie` no longer used. Use `woocommerce_cookie` instead.
* Filter `cocart_cookie_httponly` no longer used.
* Filter `cocart_cookie_supported` no longer used.
* Filter `cocart_set_cookie_options` no longer used.
* Filter `cocart_cart_use_secure_cookie` no longer used. Use `wc_session_use_secure_cookie` instead.
* Filter `cocart_is_cart_data_valid` no longer used.
* Returned headers `X-CoCart-API-Timestamp` and `X-CoCart-API-Version` no longer used.

### Developers

* Introduced new action hook `cocart_after_session_saved_data` fires after the session is saved.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_send_nocache_headers` to decide if nocache headers are sent.
* Some functions from the cart and products API v2 have been moved to there own utility class so they can be utilized outside of the plugin.
* Added utility function to check for coupon exists.
* Moved two functions from CoCart Plus to be utilized outside of the plugin.

* Tested with WooCommerce v9.0
