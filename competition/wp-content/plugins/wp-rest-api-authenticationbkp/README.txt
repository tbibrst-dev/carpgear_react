Secure and protect your WP REST API endpoints from unauthorized access. Authenticate  WordPress API using secure authentication methods. 


== Description ==
**WordPress REST API endpoints** are **open and unsecured by default** through which a hacker can access your site remotely. With our **[WordPress REST API Authentication plugin](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-rest-api-authentication)** secure your WordPress APIs from unauthorized users.  

**Protect WP REST API endpoints** from public access using [API Key Authentication](https://plugins.miniorange.com/rest-api-key-authentication-method) or [JWT Authentication](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-rest-api-jwt-authentication-method) or [Basic Authentication](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-rest-api-basic-authentication-method) or [OAuth 2.0 Authentication](https://plugins.miniorange.com/wordpress-rest-api-oauth-2-0-authentication-method) or third-party OAuth 2.0/OIDC/JWT/[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens) provider's token authentication methods. 

This plugin will make sure that only after the successful authentication, the user is allowed to access your site's resources. REST API Authentication will make your **WordPress endpoints secure from unauthorized access.**

Along with the default and standard WordPress REST API endpoints, With WP REST API Authentication you can authenticate custom-developed REST endpoints and third-party plugin REST API endpoints like that of [Woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), [Learndash](https://www.learndash.com/), [Buddypress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/), [Gravity forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/), [CoCart](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/) etc.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the use of API Authentication =
    The REST API authentication prevents unauthorized access to your WordPress APIs. It reduces potential attack factors.
	
= How can I authenticate the REST APIs using this plugin? =
	This plugin supports 5 methods: i) authentication through API key or token, ii) authentication through user credentials passed as an encrypted token, iii) authentication through JWT (JSON Web token), iv) authentication through OAuth 2.0 protocol and v) authentication via JWT token obtained from the external OAuth/OpenId providers which include Google, Facebook, Azure, AWS Cognito, Apple etc and also from Firebase. 

= Does this plugin allow authentication through JWT (JSON Web Tokens)? =
	Yes, this plugin supports REST API authentication through JWT (JSON Web token). The JWT is validated every time an API request is made, only the requested resource for the API call is allowed to access if the JWT validation is successful.

= How does the REST API Authentication plugin work? =
	You just have to select your Authentication Method in the plugin.
	Based on the method you have selected you will get the authorization code/token after sending the token request.
	Access your REST API with the code/token you received in the previous step. 

= Does this plugin provide the Basic authentication method for API authentication? = 
	Yes, the plugin provides the Basic authentication with the following 2 methods -
	a.) WP Username & Password b.) Client Credentials.
	The plugin provides you with more security of Basic auth token validation using a highly secure HMAC algorithm.

= Does this plugin enable the authentication for my custom-built REST endpoints? = 
	Yes, the plugin supports the authentication for custom-built REST endpoints using rest_api_init or register_rest_route.

= Does this plugin disable REST APIs of WordPress? =
	Yes, this plugin by default disables all the WP REST APIs which can only be accessed with allowed authentication and authorization but it provides a feature where you can choose which particular endpoints you want to disable and which one to make accessible publicly. 

= How do log in and register WordPress users using the WordPress REST API endpoint? = 
	This plugin provides this HTTP POST endpoint `wp-json/api/v1/token` also called as WordPress login API endpoint in which you can pass the user's WordPress credentials and this endpoint will validate the user and return you with the appropriate response. 
	The plugin also supports the authentication and authorization of WordPress users' register REST API.

= How to access draft posts? =
	You can access draft posts using Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0(using Username: Password), JWT authentication, and API Key auth(using Universal Key) methods. Pages/posts need to access with the status. The default status used in the request is 'Publish' and any user can access the Published post. 
	To access the pages/posts stored in the draft, you need to append the ?status=draft to the page/post request.
	For Example:
	You need to use below URL format while sending a request to access different types of posts
	1. Access draft posts only
		https://<domain>/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?status=draft
	2. Access all types of posts
		https://<domain>/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?status=any
	You just have to change the status(draft, pending, any, publish) as per your requirement. You do not have to pass the status parameter to access Published posts.

= How do I authenticate WordPress REST API endpoints using an external JWT token or access token provided by OAuth/OIDC/Social Login providers? = 
     This plugin provides you with an authentication method called the 'Third Party Provider' authentication method in which the JWT token or access token is obtained from external identities(OAuth/OIDC/JWT/JWKS providers) like Firebase, Okta, Azure, Keycloak, ADFS, AWS Cognito, Google, Facebook, Apple etc. can be passed along with API request in the header and the plugin validates that JWT / access token directly from these external sources/providers. 

= How do I access user-specific data for Woocommerce REST API without the need to pass actual Woocommerce API credentials? =
	This plugin provides a way to bypass Woocommerce security and instead authenticate APIs using the authentication methods, hence improvising the security and hence no chance of Woocommerce credentials getting compromised. The authentication token passed in the API request will validate the user and result in user-specific data only. For more information, please contact us at apisupport@xecurify.com

= How to enable API access in WooCommerce?
    You can enable API access in WooCommerce using our WP REST API Authentication plugin. Please reach out to us at apisupport@xecurify.com for more information.
	
= How to achieve auto-login between WordPress and external apps using a token or JWT token?
	To achieve the auto-login and session sharing, we have another plugin **[WordPress Login & Register using JWT](https://wordpress.org/plugins/login-register-using-jwt/)**   

= Does this plugin provide WordPress Forgot password or password reset functionality using REST API endpoint?
	Yes, with the premium plan, the plugin provides the REST API endpoint for the complete forgot password/password reset functionality securely.
